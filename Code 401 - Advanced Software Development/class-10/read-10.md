# Stacks and Queues

## Stack

A stack of data structure consists of node. Liked **LinkedLists** each Node references the next object in the stack.

Common terminology for a stack

* **Push** - Nodes or item placed on top of the stack.
* **Pop** - Node or item removed from stack
* **Top** - The top of the stack.
* **Peek** - When you view the value at the top of the stack.
* **IsEmpty** - returns true is stack is empty.

### FILO

First In Last Out

### LIFO

Last In First Out

### FILO vs LIFO

* They 

### Stack if LIFO

### Big O of the things

O(1)

## Queue

Common terminology of a queue:

* **Enqueue** - Nodes or items to be added.

* **Dequeue** - Nodes or items to be remvoed. If cue is empty: raises exception.

* **Front** - Like the top of a stack. First node in the queue

* **Reaer** - This is the rear/last node of the queue.
* **Peek** - When you peek, you view the value of the *front*.
* **IsEmpty** - returns true when the queue is empty, otherwise returns false.

### FIFO

**First In, First Out**

### LILO

**Last In Last Out**
