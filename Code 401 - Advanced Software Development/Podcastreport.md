### CommandLine Heroes, Season 7 Episode 1 (Connecting the Dot Com)

This episode of CommandLine heroes focused on the creation of the internet. A few things that stuck out to me: one is that most of the early innevators of web technology were women. This is only shocking because tech is such a male dominated space nowadays. It was also interesting how so many fundamental parts of the web were afterthoughts or accidents. The DNS structure was done sort of haphazardly, .com was put in for businesses by an intern who just made a decision. As one interviewee put it "We couldn't have done what we did if we'd known how important and influential it woudl be". The internet never "had" to happen this way. It just, did. It could have happened any number of ways and could still evolve away from what it currently is.

### Code Newbie: Seasons 16 Episode 6 (What failing technical interviews can teach you)

This episode of Code Newbie featured Farhana Mustafa. In it she hared all her experiences with technical interviews and what she learned from them. One of the best things to hear was simply how hard it was for her. I also struggle with whiteboard scenarios and often feel insecure while someone is watching me code. One of the most memorable lessons was when she interviewed at Microsoft for the secondtime. She made it past the first two interviews, and on the third interiew was asked a question she knew nothing about. She fumbled for quite some times and when it was over asked the interviewer what she could have done better. He responded "You should have said 'I don't know how to do that, but I could learn.'". That's helpful to remember: nobody can or will be expected to know everything.
