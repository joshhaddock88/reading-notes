## Lecture Notes

### Problem Domain

- F() that reverses array

- Input <- Array [1,2,4,9]

- output -> Array [9,4,2,1]

- In place? Yes.

### Algorithm

- Identiy start & end

- while start < end

    - Swap

    - arr/start/end

### Pseudo

- Declare start <- 0

- Declare end <- arr.Length -1

- While start < end

    - Declare time <- arr[start]
    - Arr[start] = Arr[end]
    - Arr[end] = temp
    - start ++
    - end --

## Solutions

A solution can have many projects. A project can have many classes. A class may have many methods. All of this together is an exe once compiled.

Void? Return type
Static? No instance needed

string[] args: a variable called args that will have an array of strings.

All methods have the same signature

static/instnace void/type Main(type variable) <- **Signature**
