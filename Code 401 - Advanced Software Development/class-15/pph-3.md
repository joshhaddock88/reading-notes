## Report

### Speaker

**Speaker**: Chris Braga
**Topic**: Neurodiversity in the workplace

Notes:

While a lot of the talk wasn't directly applicable to me, it was very cool to see how people are working to make sure talented neurodivergent people are represented in the workplace. It's important to remember that you don'tknow everyone's situation just by looking at them: neurodivergent folks aren't easy to spot and we all need to be more aware of how we expect people to interact and perform.
