# Partner Power Hour, Week 1

## Speaker: Stephen Semmelroth

### Topic of discussion: Cybersecurity

### Company: StrataCore

### Ways the speaker's information will change my approach to career transition:
- Table stakes: There are certain things you need to have done before you even show up to the table, ie dues you have to pay. Get your github lit up, create projects, have an impressive portfolio.
- Geting to the table also requires networking. Networking is everything. All of Stephen's business opportunities came from networking.

## Other key takeaways:
- Tell the stories about you that make you "you".
- Take networking in blocks. Create weekly, monthly, and yearly goals.
- Create networking metrics. When attending meetups have specific goals in mind about how many one on one conversations you want to have, how many connectoinns you want ot make etc etc. Be specific.
- "The First 90 Days" Michael D. Watkins. Important book to read going forward.
- Know yourself. Make sure you like what you're doing, that's going to drastically change what you're pursuing, how you network etc. Don't do work that doesn't make you happy.
