## Prepare to fail
Success is like the iceberg analogy. What you see is the success, but everything underneath is failure, and that's what pushes the success to the surface.
Success is a crooked line, not a straight arrow. Having a growth mindset and openness to failure is key.

Ask for help. It's ok to not understand. It's ok to get stuck. You will get stuck. You will have struggles to understand.

Growth mindset
- embrace
- persist across
- view as path to master
- learn from
- get inspired from

Emotional intelligence
- self awareness
- self regulation
- empathy
- motivation
- social awareness

This is not a competition, it is a collaboration.
