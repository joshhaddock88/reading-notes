## Why diversity matters?
- Diverse teams are more creative.
- As a rule, diverse companies perform better. This makes sense as US demographics change, companies with a diverse perspective are able to better cater to multiple needs.
- Talent is spread, more or less, evenly across groups, by not tapping into specific grops companies are losing out on great talent.
- Diverse hiring practices are ethical. Everyone should have a fair shot to use and puruse their talents.
