# Component Based Architecture

- What is a component?

"A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only." Note: not all of that makes perfect sense to me.
- What are the charactistics of a component?
  1. Reusability: designed to be reused in multiple applications to perform different or specific tasks.
  2. Replaceable: They can be substituted with similar components.
  3. Not context specific: they can work in different environments and aren't tied to the context of the code around them.
  4. Extensible: can be extended to allow for changes in behavior.
  5. Encapsulated: allows the funcationality to be called without exposing internal process/variables etc.
  6. Independant: designed to have no/minimal dependencies.
- What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
  1. Ease of deployment: that is easier to replace existing parts because components have fewer dependencies.
  2. Reduced cost: using third party components means who are not writing all of the code yourself.
  3. Ease of development: Similar to the above, if you're not reinventing the wheel every time, it's easier to build a car.
  4. Reusable: You can use the same components across multiple applications.
  5. Modification of technical complexity: complexity is only modified within the container of the component.
  6. Reliability: the entire system becomes more reliable because each component is reliable.
  7. System maintenance and evolution: much easier to change.
  8. Independance: Each component is independent from the system.

# What is Props and How to Use it in React

- What is props short for?

"properties
- How are props used in React?

  1. Attribute and it's value are defined.
  2. The child component is passed by Props.
  3. Props data is rendered.

- What is the flow of props?
It flows down, from parent to child.
