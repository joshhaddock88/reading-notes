## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?
- A smarty guy who wrote some of the first web servers.
Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- While Roy Fielding may have written his protocols with international machine speak, not everyone did, and so much of the internet was built around only a few machines talking to a few other machines. There isn't the concept of a universal "noun" amongst machines.
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- It's all about applying verbs to multiple nouns. It does this with an HTTP GET.
What does a GET do?
- Using HTTP it goes and "gets" all the "nouns" and assembles them. Text, images etc.
What does a POST do?
- Add something to another system.
What does PUT do?
- Replace something in another system.
What does PATCH do?
- A partial update on another system.
