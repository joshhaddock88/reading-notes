Think about passing money vs passing a debit card.

The teacher has to two kids: one in Oregon and one in Washington. They can't share money.

If he gives them cash then he's given them something one time. When it gets used it's gone.

By giving them a debit card, they have access to his bank account. So now they both have a revloving access to his money.

This is how data passing in React works.

API: Applicatoin Programming Interface
- Communication Contract
- It's like ordering at starbucks. If you don't use the correct language you won't get what you're looking for.
- McDonalds is an API. You go up and say "I want a burger" and they say "That'll be a dollar", you give them a dollar and they give you a burger. That's how it works.
- If you go to McDonalds and say "I want whiskey" and you give them a shoe, you don't get anything. That's how API's work.
- You make a request with some criteria, and are given something.

EVERYTHING is an API, it just depends on how small they are and how big they get.
