**\<img>** tag. Requires **src**, **alt**, and **title**.

**src** tells the browser where to find the image.

**alt** provides a text description of the image for screen readers.

**title** can proivide additional info.

Height and width can be handled in HTML, but it's better left to CSS.

The image tag can be placed inside other elements and does not have a closing tag.

Page positioning can be handled in HTML, but once again, it is best practice to leave that to HTML.

Website images should be saved in png, jpeg, or gif formats.

jpegs are best for images with varied color. png is best for low color large images.

**vector** images are not resolution dependant.

**\<figure>** tag exists so that images and their captions can be associated in a single element.

**\<figcaption> is for what it sounds like.

## Chapter 11, HTML

## PNG vs JPEG vs GIF

JPEG is a lossy compression. JPEGS are best suited for photographs etc because compression works by averging nearby pixel colors.

PNG are lossless and sharper. They're more suitable for logos etc.

GIF used to be used like PNG, but not that PNG is supported on all platforms it's mostly used for animated memes.

JPEG can support 16 million colors

PNG 24 can too. PNG8, fewer.

GIF only has 256. lol. However, only GIF can support animation.
