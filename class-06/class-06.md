- images should be saved in their own folder.
- on larger sites you may want subfolders within folders.

**\<img>** tag. Requires **src**, **alt**, and **title**.

**src** tells the browser where to find the image.

**alt** provides a text description of the image for screen readers.

**title** can proivide additional info.

Height and width can be handled in HTML, but it's better left to CSS.

The image tag can be placed inside other elements and does not have a closing tag.

Page positioning can be handled in HTML, but once again, it is best practice to leave that to HTML.

Website images should be saved in png, jpeg, or gif formats.

jpegs are best for images with varied color. png is best for low color large images.

**vector** images are not resolution dependant.

**\<figure>** tag exists so that images and their captions can be associated in a single element.

**\<figcaption> is for what it sounds like.
