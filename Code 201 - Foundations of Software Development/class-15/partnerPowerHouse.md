What is Cryptography?
 - hash function: stores the data in somehting that looks nothing like the data. It can't be unencrypted.

 b-crypt: decryption by comparison. It won't tell you what the thing is, but it can tell you if the plain text and encryption match, even though they're not the same.
 salt = complexity.
 b-crypt is 5-10 levels of complexity.
